      CORE CHECKLIST:
      1. Follow rules (`.cursor/rules/`) when writing code. Suggest updates to rules when needed.
      2. Always have a spec (`specs/`). Review it before coding and keep it up to date.
      3. Follow testing guidelines (`.cursor/rules/testing.mdc`) and ensure adequate test coverage.
