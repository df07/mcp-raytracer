# MCP Raytracer (TypeScript) - ABANDONED

⚠️ **This repository is no longer maintained and has been abandoned in favor of [df07/go-progressive-raytracer](https://github.com/df07/go-progressive-raytracer).**

## About

This was a TypeScript implementation of a raytracer built as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, created largely following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) series with some references to [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Practice](https://www.pbrt.org/). Built using Cursor and Claude-4-Sonnet.

It featured:

- Ray tracing with support for spheres, planes, and other geometric primitives
- Material system with reflection, refraction, and lighting
- MCP server integration for AI-assisted rendering
- Benchmarking capabilities
- Built with TypeScript and gl-matrix for 3D math

## Why Abandoned?

This TypeScript implementation has been superseded by a more performant and feature-rich Go implementation. The Go version offers:
- Better performance for compute-intensive ray tracing operations
- More advanced rendering features
- Continued development and maintenance

## Migration

**Please use [df07/go-progressive-raytracer](https://github.com/df07/go-progressive-raytracer) instead.**
